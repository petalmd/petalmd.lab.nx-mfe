Currently uninstalled but will probably be necessary : 

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`

## Generate an application

Run `npx nx g @nx/angular:host appName` for a new Module Federated Angular Shell Application
Run `npx nx g @nx/angular:remote appName --host=shellName` for a new Angular Remote Application

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

## Development server

Run `npx nx serve shellName --devRemotes=remote1Name,remote2Name` to run your shell application with its remotes

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests
